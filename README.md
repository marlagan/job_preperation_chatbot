I created a chatbot that allows users to prepare for jobs in the AI field. For this project, I designed a custom JSON file containing questions and responses that a job candidate might find beneficial and easy to use. The JSON file was processed using Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques, such as tokenizing sentences with the NLTK library, lowercasing words, and applying lemmatization to reduce words based on the context. After going through this process, all the questions were reconstructed into bags of words.
To match user questions with appropriate responses, I built a model using the PyTorch library. The model consists of linear layers and was trained to recognize correct tags for questions. A user interface was written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend API uses Flask.
